# HMCL-PE setting interface modification

Its modification method is almost the same as the in-game hover window modification method.

The only difference is that you need to find the modification screen on the home page of HMCL-PE

You can skip to [this section](../../basic-settings/global-game-settings/control-layout-pattern.md) to get the way to find it: [Here](../../basic-settings/global-game-settings/control-layout-pattern.md)
