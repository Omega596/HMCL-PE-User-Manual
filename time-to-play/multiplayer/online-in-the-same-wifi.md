Remember your port!

Your server IP is `localhost:port`, you need to send it to your friend.

### Member player:

You need to ask the host player for port, then add a server to the multiplayer game sector of the game.

The name of the server is the same as the world name? I don't know personally, and the server address is filled like this localhost:25565, and the server can be added.
