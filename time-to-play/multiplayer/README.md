# Multiplayer

You need to make sure that two people have downloaded the **exact same Minecraft version** before playing in multiplayer, otherwise it almost always will glitch in some way.

The same file is required (If your minecraft version folder does not have certain folders, you can ignore):

* Config
* Mods
* Resource packs
* Scripts(CraftTweaker Mod's recipe modification file)

You have five ways to play multiplayer games

* **Go find a server created by someone else**, download the corresponding client, get the server IP and connect.
* Use HMCL-PE's **built-in multiplayer function**
* **Online in the same Wifi**
* **Buy a server or VPS**, or use "**intranet penetration**" for online access
